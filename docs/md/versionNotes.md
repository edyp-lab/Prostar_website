  * Export as Excel file: additional sheet with DAPAR and Prostar version number used to process the dataset
  
  
  
### News in Prostar 1.30.7

#### Bugs fixed
  * Buggy plots have been temporarly disabled in aggregation process
  * Bug fixed while converting a text/Excel file to a MSnset file (issue with the versions of Prostar and DAPAR)


  
### News in Prostar 1.30.6

#### Bugs fixed
  * Bug fixed in agregation tool for peptide-level pipeline

  
#### New features
  * A popup windows appears if the dataset which is loaded was built with an older version of Prostar than
  the running one. Prostar will continue to run but the user is informed that unexpected behaviour may happen in this case.
  
### News in Prostar 1.30.5

#### Bugs fixed
  * Bug fixed in the filtering tool with the cell metadata tags


### News in Prostar 1.30.4

#### Bugs fixed
  * Small bug fixed in the normalization tool

  
  
### News in Prostar 1.30.3

#### Bugs fixed
  * In the imputation tool: all imputation methods are functional again
  * Bug fixed in the Student's test (the value of logFC is now correct and consistent with Limma)

  
#### New features
  * In case of error during the execution of some processes(), a popup window - containing the text of the error - will be shown.
  
  
  
  
### News in Prostar 1.30.2

#### Bugs fixed
  * In the normalization tool:
    * the intensity plots (violinplot and boxplot) are displayed again
    * the display of the comparative plot (before and after normalization) is faster, which speeds up the overall normalisation process.
  
  
### News in Prostar 1.30.1
#### New features
  * Differential analysis : a new information has been included concerning the 'push p-value' feature. This information is the number of entities that have been pushed
  * Missing values imputation in pipeline at protein: In the 'Missing on Entire Condition' step, the info text after impuation was confusing. Now, when the imputation has been achieved a more explicit message( giving the number of imputed proteins) is displayed
  * Metacell tags have been renamed. For more information, please got to the FAQ
  

#### Bugs fixed
  * In the filtering tool, when selecting a tag which not appeared in the dataset, all the lines were deleted. This has been fixed. Moreover, the list of tags to choose now reflects only the tags that are really in the dataset and not all the tags available in DAPAR
  * Bug fixed in "Open a MSnset" ("Attempt to select less than one element in get1index")

### News in Prostar 1.28

#### New features
* In the 'Hypothesis testing' tool, the interface for the 'Swap conditions' option has been updated (a collapsible panel has been added).
* Textual information has been added in the imputation tool when the dataset contains no missing values. This prevents any user to run an imputation on such datasets (which made some imputation methods crash)

#### Bugs fixed
* [1.28.5]
  * Improvements of the Differential Analysis tool, especially the information and tooltips related to the volcanoplot.
* [1.28.0]
  * The 'Reset' action button in 'Differential Analysis' has been fixed. Now, the 'Push p-value' widgets are also set back to default values.
  * Bug fixed when exporting a peptide dataset as an Excel file
  * The 'Reload Prostar' button works now (Prostar used to crash when the user clicked on the button)
  * Bug fixed in 'Normalization' tool when normalizing with tags in a 'Specific column'
  * Bug fixed with the Push p-value feature in 'Differential analysis' tool.
  * Prostar can now handle peptide datasets in which the protein accession contains "|" (The problem occurred during  connected component computation)
  * Bug fixed about the display of quantitative metadata in the data explorer (the columns and their names were not aligned)
  * Bug fixed about Prostar freeze when saving the aggregated dataset.


### News in Prostar 1.26

#### New features
* In the 'Convert' tool, implementation of a new way to select the nature of quantitative data for each sample
* Add colors to cells metadata tags in Excel export file
* The 'swap volcanolplot' feature in Differential Analysis has been removed.  It is replaced by a new feature in the 'Hypothesis Test' tool where it is now possible to swap the conditions of any comparison. This leads to a new list of comparisons which are available in the 'Differential analysis' tool.

#### Bug fixed
* [1.26.4]
  * Fixes a bug with the Swap feature in the Hypothesis Test tool. When the user has swaped a first comparison and want to swap a second comparison, the first one was automatically swaped again.
  * Fixed a bug with the Reset button in the differential analysis which did not reset the parameters of the Push p-value tool.
* [1.26.3]
  * The function Prostar() works now when the user wants to launch Prostar via a R console.
  
* [1.26.2]
  * The selection of tooltips in the volcanoplot works now. It no longer stay on the default one but is updated with the current user selection for tooltips. 
  * Bug fixed with the 'Reset' button in the 'Hypothesis Test' tool
  
* [1.26.1]
  * A bug has been fixed in the computation of the t-test (in the Hypothesis test tool). The logFC value for a given
  comparison was swaped and not consistent with the computation of LogFC in Limma.
  * In the Differential Analysis tool, the small info table about the number of selected entities is showed
  * A bug fixed in the Filter tool with the tab 'Quanti. metadata filtering' or with the 'Push p-value' feature in the Differential Analysis tool. Now, both 'keep' and 'delete' options work.
  
* [1.26.0]
  * Bug fixed in demo datasets (package 'DAPARdata') related to the cell metadata tags for quantitative values.
  * A bug in the function which exports datasets to MSnSets has been fixed.
  * 'Aggregation tool': Bug fixed with the 'proteinId' on new aggregated protein dataset.
  * Bug fixed with the feature '#/% of values to delete' when selecting '%'. This bug occurred in the 'Filtering tool > Quanti. metadata filtering' and the 'Differentiel analysis > Push p-value'
  * Bug fixed in select metadata information for Aggregation



### News in Prostar 1.24

#### New features
* Fully operational peptidomics and peptide-level workflows.
*	Addition of a cell metadata tag about quantitative values (it indicates for each condition and each entity (either protein or peptide) whether it is a quantitative, missing or imputed value. 
*	The missing value filtering tool has been replaced by a filter tool that operates on quantitative cell metadata. A more user-friendly GUI is provided.
* Missing values barplots have been generalized to any type of cell metadata tag.
*	The information available in cell metadata is now accounted for during the aggregation step.

When the user choose to select identification methods, it is now mandatory to choose appropriate column names.
  * Add comma as separating character for protIds (Use to generate adjacency matrices)
* [1.24.7]
  * Bug fixed within the 'Convert tool', in the 'Build design' tab where the use of 'Order conditions' did not apply to the quantitative cell metadata. Now, this functionality works.

  * A 'keyId' field has been in the aggregated dataset. It is the same feature as in the Convert tool but, during the aggregation process, it is set automatically - based on the adjacency matrix)
* [1.24.4]
  * During the conversion process, the following error ("CreateMSnSet: unused argument (indFData=indexForFData") has been fixed.
  * The push p-value interface is now consistent with the one in the filtering tool. Furthermore, the user cannot run successive "Push p-value" operations. if he runs several times the "Push p-value button", the dataset is now automatically reset to the original comparison.
  * Bug fixed in the plot which shows the number of lines with <quant. metadata> tags which appears in the filtering tool (tab "Quanti. metadata filtering") and the menu "Descriptive statistics" (tab "Quantitative nature")
  * The error message "Argument 'obj' is missing with no default" in the preview filtering example (in the tab "Quantitative nature") has been fixed.
