### Roadmap for Prostar 2.0

#### New features
* To Be Announced - Many Great Stuff! ðŸ˜‰

### News in Prostar 1.24

#### New features
* Add a quantitative cell metadata tag (metacell) which indicates, for each condition and each entity (protein, peptide) whether it is a quantitative, missing, imputed of combined value. Each of these tags is further detailed with specific info
* The missing value filtering tool has been replaced by a filter tool that operates on quantitative cell metadata. A more user-friendly GUI is implemented.
* Missing values barplots have been replaced by barplots on metacell.
* Integration of quantitative cell metadata in the aggregation process from peptides to proteins
* Better managment of colors for plots
* When converting a dataset into a MSnSet object, the log-transformation is run after have set all 0 values to NA

#### Bug fixed

* [1.24.3]
  * Update the download functionality to get the list of proteins and peptides that make the agregation      failed.
  * Bugs fixed in plots of 'Quantitative nature' of entities
* [1.24.2]
  * Bug fixed with the Reset button in DIfferential Analysis and the 'Push p-value' functionality
* [1.24.1]
  * Fixed a bug with the number of digits when displaying numbers (such as in quantitative data tables)
  * 

* [1.24.0]
  * Enhancement of the selection of pi0 value in differential analysis tool
  * Bug fixed when the user wants to impute values after have just display the normalization tool without     process any normalization
  * Fixed bug in differential analysis: The push p-value did not work on One-vs-All comparisons.
  * Bug fixed with normalization on some selected proteins.


  
### News in Prostar 1.22

#### New features
* Functionalities enabling the focus on a protein (or a subset of proteins) to compare the normalization options.
* Possibility to apply normalization with respect to a user-defined subset of reference proteins.
* Missing values filtering: It is now possible to tune the filtering option with proportions, in addition to with absolute values.
* Missing values filtering and "Push p-values" (in Differential analysis tool): one can now select either numeric values or percentage of NA or imputed values.
* In DAPAR, implementation of ANOVA tools

#### Bug fixed
* [1.22.10]
  * Bug fixed in convert tool
* [1.22.6]
  * Fixed issue when converting a dataset into MSnSet and select columns which correspond to the origin
  of quantitative values (e.g. 'By_MS/MS', 'By_Matching', etc..)
  * Bug fixed in normalization tool when the user wants to normalize on a selection of protein. Now, there is no need to check 'Synchronize' option to proceed to the normalization.
  * The volcanoplot in the differential analysis tool now updates automatically when the user clicks on the 'Push p-value' button.
* [1.22.5]
  * Bug fixed when Prostar is used with R > 4.0.0 (Convert tool crashes)
  * MEC imputation crashed after POV imputation using KNN
* [1.22.4] 
  * Bug fixed in Welch/Student hypothesis tests.
* Bug fixed in the convert tool, introduced by R-4.0.3,
* The extension of the exported file has been corrected
* Bug fixed in MEC imputation after the POV imputation proceeded with KNN


### News in Prostar 1.20

#### New features
* Implementation of for more complex experimental designs,
* Automatic clustering of protein expression profiles,
* Additional preliminary filtering option for match between run based evidence.

#### Bug fixed
* Typos corrections
* Optimisation of Convert Data tool

### News in Prostar 1.18

#### New features
* Warning on the FDR if the number of selected peptides/proteins is too small.
* Computation of the number of shared and specific peptides per protein in the aggregation tool. Notably useful for filtering.
* Filters on numerical values.
* New tool for exploring and visualize peptide-protein graphs.
* New navigation principle to switch between differents steps of a process.
* Better default filenames when the user click on downloads Button or on export buttons above the different tables in Prostar

#### Bug fixed
* [1.18.6]
  * Due to some instability of cache memory when successively opening several datasets in a Prostar session, data management has been simplified. To work on another dataset than the current one, reloading Prostar first is now necessary (with the button above).  It will restart Prostar with a fresh R session where import menus are enabled 'Dataset manager' menu.
* [1.18.4]
  * Spinner wheels showed during the computation of plots were replaced by a progress bar at the bottom right of the window.
* [1.18.3] 
  * Bug fixed in retro-compatibility with certain MSnset datasets created with previsous versions of Prostar.
  * Bug fixed in the Color settings UI.
* [1.18.2] Bug fixed in the volcanoplots.
* [1.18.1] Bug fixed in the dataset convert tool.
* In the convert tool (build design step), the reordering of conditions is now functional. In the same screen, bug fixed when the user wants to show design examples.
* Export of a dataset when several metadata are selected to be integrated to the export file
* Bug fixed in the navigation bar for each process: the reset button is functional
* Inconsistent behaviour when the user changes a dataset in any process UI

### News in Prostar 1.16

#### New features
* New customized theme according to Prostar logo colors.
* Uniform organization of the method parameters.
* Three buttons are displayed above each tab to export the data (Copy to clipboard, export to CSV, print).
* In the CV distribution plot (Descriptive statistics), a convenient zoom is predefined.

#### Bug fixed
* [1.16.10] Bug fixed in imputation tools (package imp4p) when the dataset has not samples grouped by conditions. Bug fixed which appeared sometimes in the Export tool.
* [1.16.9] Bug fixed in hypothesis testing when the dataset has samples not grouped by conditions
* [1.16.8] Bug fixed: The logFC value calculated by t.test was the opposite as the real one (-log(FC))
* [1.16.7] Bug fixed which have made wrong Fold Change computation in a specific case : when the dataset contains conditions with different number of samples AND the names of the conditions were not in an alphabetic order
* [1.16.6] Delete 'copy to clipboard' button in the 'Bug report' screen
* [1.16.5] Bug fixed in intensity values during conversion
* [1.16.4] Bug fixed when converting into MSnset some datasets with no shared peptides
* [1.16.2] Set 'No' as default value for order conditions in convert data
* [1.16.1] Colors of different conditions in missing values plots ()
* Interactive quantitative data display from volcanoplot.
* Aggregation statistics corrected.
* Differential analysis is now working with Firefox.
* Sum aggregation function is back.
* In string-based filtering, reusing several times the same column is possible.
* Added more numerical precision of p-values in exported dataset (differential analysis)
