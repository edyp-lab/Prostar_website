### Roadmap for Prostar 2.0

#### New features
* To Be Announced - Many Great Stuff! ðŸ˜‰

### Roadmap for Prostar 1.24

#### New features
* Implementation of statistics test (ANOVA) for more complex experimental designs
* Clustering of proteins
* Integration of the type of identification (by MS/MS, by matching) within the missing values filtering.

### News in Prostar 1.22
Only a few features have been introduced in this version. Our main efforts are focused on developping Prostar 2.0.

#### New features
* Add the 'protein tracking' functionality in the normalization tool for protein datasets. It allows to:
  * view intensities of proteins (selected by the user) in the boxplot and the violin plot,
  * normalize the whole dataset with the intensities of these selected proteins.
* Missing values filtering tool: the user can also filter missing values on 

#### Bug fixed
* Bug fixed in the convert tool, introduced by R-4.0.3,
* The extension of the exported file has been corrected,
* Bug fixed in MEC imputation after the POV imputation proceeded with KNN


### News in Prostar 1.20

#### New features
* NA: [dev freezed since 1.18.6 - we are working on Prostar 2.0]

#### Bug fixed
* NA: [dev freezed since 1.18.6 - we are working on Prostar 2.0]

### News in Prostar 1.18

#### New features
* Warning on the FDR if the number of selected peptides/proteins is too small.
* Computation of the number of shared and specific peptides per protein in the aggregation tool. Notably useful for filtering.
* Filters on numerical values.
* New tool for exploring and visualize peptide-protein graphs.
* New navigation principle to switch between differents steps of a process.
* Better default filenames when the user click on downloads Button or on export buttons above the different tables in Prostar

#### Bug fixed
* [1.18.6]
  * Due to some instability of cache memory when successively opening several datasets in a Prostar session, data management has been simplified. To work on another dataset than the current one, reloading Prostar first is now necessary (with the button above).  It will restart Prostar with a fresh R session where import menus are enabled 'Dataset manager' menu.
* [1.18.4]
  * Spinner wheels showed during the computation of plots were replaced by a progress bar at the bottom right of the window.
* [1.18.3] 
  * Bug fixed in retro-compatibility with certain MSnset datasets created with previsous versions of Prostar.
  * Bug fixed in the Color settings UI.
* [1.18.2] Bug fixed in the volcanoplots.
* [1.18.1] Bug fixed in the dataset convert tool.
* In the convert tool (build design step), the reordering of conditions is now functional. In the same screen, bug fixed when the user wants to show design examples.
* Export of a dataset when several metadata are selected to be integrated to the export file
* Bug fixed in the navigation bar for each process: the reset button is functional
* Inconsistent behaviour when the user changes a dataset in any process UI

### News in Prostar 1.16

#### New features
* New customized theme according to Prostar logo colors.
* Uniform organization of the method parameters.
* Three buttons are displayed above each tab to export the data (Copy to clipboard, export to CSV, print).
* In the CV distribution plot (Descriptive statistics), a convenient zoom is predefined.

#### Bug fixed
* [1.16.10] Bug fixed in imputation tools (package imp4p) when the dataset has not samples grouped by conditions. Bug fixed which appeared sometimes in the Export tool.
* [1.16.9] Bug fixed in hypothesis testing when the dataset has samples not grouped by conditions
* [1.16.8] Bug fixed: The logFC value calculated by t.test was the opposite as the real one (-log(FC))
* [1.16.7] Bug fixed which have made wrong Fold Change computation in a specific case : when the dataset contains conditions with different number of samples AND the names of the conditions were not in an alphabetic order
* [1.16.6] Delete 'copy to clipboard' button in the 'Bug report' screen
* [1.16.5] Bug fixed in intensity values during conversion
* [1.16.4] Bug fixed when converting into MSnset some datasets with no shared peptides
* [1.16.2] Set 'No' as default value for order conditions in convert data
* [1.16.1] Colors of different conditions in missing values plots ()
* Interactive quantitative data display from volcanoplot.
* Aggregation statistics corrected.
* Differential analysis is now working with Firefox.
* Sum aggregation function is back.
* In string-based filtering, reusing several times the same column is possible.
* Added more numerical precision of p-values in exported dataset (differential analysis)
